# JojoAPI

JojoAPI is a modding API for Jojo's Bizzare Adventure All-Star Battle R. It's in a very early stage of development, but it's already possible to create mods with it! (And i'll try to make the API as stable as possible, so you don't have to worry about your mods breaking with every update)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of `JAPIUpdater.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Kapilarny/JAPI/releases)
2. Drag&drop the file into your game folder (where the `ASBR.exe` is located)
3. Run `JAPIUpdater.exe` instead of `ASBR.exe`
4. Enjoy!
